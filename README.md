# Clk
2017 UQ ENGG2800 Team Project 1 item. A clock was required to be designed, developed, and built, meeting certain criteria. This is our team's (Team 01) design.
The microcontroller firmware is written in C and is designed to run on an ATmega328P. LEDs are controlled using the light_ws2812 library: https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812.
The GUI is written in Python using the TkInter package. The pySerial library is used to transmit data packets via a serial port.

Created by Huy Nguyen, Alex Subaric, and Barnaby Whiteman.
